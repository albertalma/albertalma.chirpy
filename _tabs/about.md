I’m a Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience across different areas of tech: from mobile development and QA to backend services, before diving headfirst into video game development.

For the past 6 years, I’ve been focused on crafting AI and gameplay experiences that feel alive, working with Unreal Engine (C++), GAS, AI frameworks, and animation systems. I’m always eager to solve problems, help others, and I’m not afraid to get my hands dirty to make things happen.

Along the way, I’ve mentored teams, shared knowledge, and contributed to both AAA and AA projects. Always with the goal of transforming complex technical challenges into experiences players will love.

I’m currently based in Spain and looking for new opportunities locally or remote, while remaining open to relocation for the right project.
